Classic Tic Tac Toe Game
Hi everyone! I made a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against the CPU. This is my first large Java project and I wanted to use both loops and conditional statements. At the end, the result is printed out onto the screen. To improve the app, I hope to make some stylistic changes to make the game more visually pleasing and include a mode where the players can play either against each other or with the CPU. I hope you enjoy playing and this code gives you some ideas.
